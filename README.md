# Functional Programming in Elm

This resource focuses on the *techniques* of functional programming.

You can read it online **[here](https://functional-programming-in-elm.netlify.com)**!

Readers are expected to have worked through [An Introduction to Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/) which provides a baseline understanding of the core language, The Elm Architecture, union types, modules, etc. This resource focuses on using these tools *effectively*.

## About Suggestions

There are many ways to improve this book. Many of them require structural changes that would present concepts in a better order. Changes like this are quite difficult, especially in a collaborative way. I want the book to come out coherent more than I want it to address every possible concern.

**If you want to make a PR**, the kinds of PRs that are practical to handle include:

- Fixing misspellings
- Fixing broken links
- Fixing typos in code

Make a PR as small as possible. Reviewing a typo is easy. Reviewing 10 typos is hard because 9 may be good. Now there is a bigger coordination overhead.

**If you want to record an issue**, make sure you share:

- Your programming background
- How you found the guide
- Why you want to learn this language
- The thing you found confusing

The answers do not have to be super elaborate. I just need to understand who is confused and why. As I learn more about the readers, it is possible to revamp the book that addresses their concerns in a coherent way. Ultimately I must pick an audience, so it fundamentally cannot work for everyone. Choices must be made!
